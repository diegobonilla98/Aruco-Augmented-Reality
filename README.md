# Aruco-Augmented-Reality
Some interesting tests with the OpenCV Aruco markers.


## Warning!
This is some scripts I've made for tests and/or meaningless projects. They are not made to be easy to understand, optimized nor working. They surely have some interesting stuff so for any questions please talk to me in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-bonilla-salvador/).
